## "checking.sage"
Used to verify the finitely many cases left for Theorem 1.8.

## "zgap.sage"
Used to obtain a big-o constant for the case $k\geq 6$.

## "4bigO.sage"
Used to derive a big-O constant for the case $k=4$.

## "rfz.sage"
Computes all roots for a level up to $N=10$.

## "functions.sage"
Contains functions used in "checking.sage".
## "roots"
This directory contains some roots computed up to level $N=10$. Each line of a "N__rfzs.txt" file contains an array in the following format:
$$[N, m, \varepsilon(f), z_1,z_2,...z_{2m+2}],$$
where $z_i$ is a root of $r_f(z)$.
